# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the PRETRAIN class from old_train_candi.py into a cleaner, more modular structure in train.py. The refactoring aims to simplify the code by breaking down the main training method into helper functions, integrate with the optimized data loading from data.py, and add support for multi-GPU training. The goal is to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability while addressing potential mistakes and suboptimalities in the original implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PRETRAIN class refactored into train.py with modular helper methods, so that the code is cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored code is executed, THEN it SHALL produce equivalent training results to the original PRETRAIN class.

2. IF helper methods are used, THEN each SHALL perform a single, well-defined responsibility (e.g., setup, batch processing, metrics computation).

3. WHILE refactoring, the main training loop SHALL be simplified by delegating complex logic to private helper methods starting with '_'.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want the training code to integrate with the optimized data loading from data.py, so that data handling is efficient and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the trainer, THEN it SHALL use CANDIIterableDataset or equivalent from data.py for data loading.

2. IF data loading fails, THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing the training process. 

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher using multiple GPUs, I want the training to support multi-GPU via DDP, so that I can scale training across multiple devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple GPUs are available, THEN the training SHALL distribute the workload using torch.distributed.

2. IF running in single-GPU mode, THEN it SHALL fall back to standard training without errors.

3. WHILE training, model synchronization and gradient reduction SHALL occur correctly across GPUs.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want potential mistakes and suboptimalities in the original code identified and fixed, so that the refactored version is more robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the original code, THEN all identified issues (e.g., memory leaks, inefficient loops) SHALL be addressed in the refactor.

2. IF early stopping or progress monitoring is suboptimal, THEN it SHALL be improved (e.g., based on validation metrics).
